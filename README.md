# Design Pattern Examples

## Why?

To be honest, I'm a complete beginner at Java and I'm trying to learn it. I've been reading a lot about design patterns and I think the best way to learn them is to implement them. So, I'm trying to implement them in Java.

## How?

So far, I'll be implementing the patterns and keeping track here

- [x] Observer
- [x] Decorator
- [x] Singleton
- [ ] Factory
- [ ] Command
- [ ] Adapter and Facade
- [ ] Template Method
- [ ] Iterator and Composite
- [ ] State
- [ ] Proxy
- [ ] Compound Patterns

## From Where?

These patterns are learnt and implemented guided from O'Reily's Head First Design Patterns book.
I'm trying to implement them in Java, but I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.
So, if you find any mistakes, please let me know. As usual I'm available for mail on `20cs01043[at]iitbbs[dot]ac[dot]in`
